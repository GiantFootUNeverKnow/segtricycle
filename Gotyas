## From UVA 10400, I know that sometimes DFS can outrun BFS greatly because you don't need travel through all possibilities in some
## situations. When DFS reaches one of the solutions, it can terminate immediately while BFS has to spend long long time searching 
## no single solution.
## Also, from UVA 10400, I used repetitive trimming to speed up DFS. You record some states you have searched and skip that state whenever 
## you meet it again.

##From UVA 714, which I didn't AC, I learned a way to figure out the Least Largest Element problem --- Binary Search!
##,though it is not a key to all similar problems...
